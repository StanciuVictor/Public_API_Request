# [Public API Request](https://stanciuvictor.github.io/Public_API_Request/)

This app uses fetch API to grab information for 12 random users from [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/). It requests a JSON object from the API and parses the data so that 12 users are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location.

Clicking the user's image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the user's birthday and address.

<!-- ## Style changes
